# Activo Rails #

This gem provides a Rails 3 engine which makes using the Activo web application theme
a more pleasant process.

It places all the required assets in the right places, and
provides an application layout, saving you from having to strip out the relevant bits
and build it yourself everytime.

There are also a few view helpers available to simplify the creation of common UI elements
such as button lists, breadcrumbs, and menus.

## Installing ##

To install the theme add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "activo-rails"

And then run `bundle install`. If you have an application layout then you'll need to remove
or rename it, since your application's assets will always take priority.

## Hello, World! ##

A basic view, with a single content block, and a page title would look something like this.

    <% page_title "Hello, world!" %>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
        <div class="inner">
          <p>This is a basic Activo template.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

Unfortunatly there's a bit of divitis involved in using Activo. I'd like to reduce that with
some more helpers, but I'm not entirely sure how to do so cleanly at the moment. It's probably
worth it though.

If you're using a decent text editor, it should be automatable anyway.

## View Helpers ##

There are a few view helpers available to use which deal with some of the more awkward parts of
Activo.

### Setting the Page Title ###

As shown in the previous example, you can call `page_title` to set the title to be displayed.

    <% page_title "My Lovely Page" %>

### Icons ###

To display icons use the `icon` helper. Activo includes the Fatcow icons from www.fatcow.com/free-icons,
which are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license. It's up to you to either
comply with that license, or replace them with something else.

    <%= icon "delete", :large, :alt => "Delete Item" %>

The first argument is the filename of the icon, without extension.

The second is the size. :small gives a 16x16 icon, :large gives 32x32.

Finally, a hash of options. Currently the only valid option is :alt which sets the alt text to be
included in the image tag. Further options will probably be supported in the future.

### Navigation Tabs ####

The `secondary_navigation` helper is used to add some tabs to the top of a content block.
    
    <% page_title "About Us" %>

    <div class="block">
      <%= secondary_navigation do |n|
        n.item "The Company", about_path("company"), :active => true
        n.item "Our Offices", about_path("offices")
        n.item "Jobs", about_path("jobs"), :class => "highlighted"
      end %>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="inner">
          <p>We're an amazing company! We do things!</p>
          <p>To find out more, click the tabs above.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

Each item can be passed a hash of options. Valid options are:

  active (boolean): If set to true, the tab will be highlighted as the current tab.
  class (string): Additional classes to apply to the tab.
  link\_options (hash): A hash of options to pass to link\_to.

### Breadcrumbs ###

These are much like tabs, but appear at the bottom of a block as a trail of pages.
They're added using the `breadcrumbs` helper.

    <% page_title "News Item 3" %>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>News Item 3</h2>
        <div class="inner">
          <p>We've got some new news here. Read all about it!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <%= breadcrumbs do |b|
        b.item "Home", root_path
        b.item "News", news_path
        b.item "News Item 3", news_path(3), :active => true
      end %> 
    </div>

Valid options are teh same as for tabs.

### Controls ###

To add a set of buttons to the top of a block, use the `controls` helper.

    <% page_title "News Item 3 (Admin Mode)" %>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="content">
        <%= controls do |c|
          c.item "Delete", news_path(3), :link_options => { :method => :delete, :confirm => "Really delete News Item 3?" }, :icon => "delete"
          c.item "Edit", edit_news_path(3), :icon => "edit"
        end %>
        <h2>News Item 3</h2>
        <div class="inner">
          <p>We've got some new news here. Read all about it!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

Valid options are the same as for tabs, with an additional `icon` option, which will be passed
to the `icon` helper.

## Customising the Layout ##

You probably want to add a few menus of your own, and maybe a sidebar as well. That's done by
providing some helpers within your application which if they exist will be called by Activo to
fill in the empty spaces.

### Navigation ###

The main and user navigation areas at the top of the page are populated in the same way. The main
navigation is the text based one on the left hand side, while the user navigation is the row of icons
on the right.

To populate them create a helper called either `main_navigation` or `user_navigation`. The method
will be passed a NavigationBuilder instance which can be filled with items.
    
    module ApplicationHelper
      def main_navigation(menu)
        menu.item "Home", root_path
        menu.iten "News", news_path, :active => true
      end
    end

When populating the user navigation you probably want to make the first argument a call to `image_tag`
since the space available isn't big enough for anything other icons.

### Status ###

In the top right, opposite the logo, there's a section which can be filled with text to notify your users
of important information. If a `status_menu` helper exists, the return value will be used to fill that space.
    
    module ApplicationHelper
      def status_menu
        "Welcome back Jon!"
      end
    end

### The Sidebar ###

The sidebar is filled by a `sidebar` helper if one exists.
    
    module ApplicationHelper
      def sidebar
        content_tag("div", :class => "block") do
          content_tag("ul", :class => "navigation") do
            content_tag("li", link_to("News Item 3", news_path(3)))
          end
        end
      end
    end

It's probably easier to render a partial here, especially if your sidebar is going to change frequently.

### Hiding the Sidebar ###

If you don't want a sidebar at all you can expand the content area to fill the available space. Set the `full_width`
instance variable to do so.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      before_filter :hide_sidebar
      
      def hide_sidebar
        @full_width = true
      end
      protected :hide_sidebar
    end

## Using Formtastic ##

Activo is already set up to be used with Formtastic, but doesn't directly depend on it, since form
builders are very much a matter of taste.

If you would like to use it (and I recommend it), then just add `gem 'formtastic'` to your Gemfile, and everything
will work out of the box.

## Contributing ##

This is currently a very young gem. I'm using it in a couple of projects quite happily, but it could certainly
use some smoothing out of the edges, and more view helpers. If you want to contribute, fork this repository, and
send me a pull request when your feature is ready.
